========

This section contains various examples of how to use DataService.
It should give you a good overview of the library's capabilities and how to use them.
This series of tutorials assumes that your are familiar with Python and have a basic understanding of web scraping,
in particular with the `BeautifulSoup <https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/>`_ library.
Some knowledge of recursion, generators and functional programming is also helpful.

Please note that the purpose of these examples is to demonstrate the capabilities of DataService,
not to provide a comprehensive guide to web scraping / data gathering.
